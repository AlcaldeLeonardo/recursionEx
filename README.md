# Recursion Exercises

This exercises proposed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) provide
a set of practice problems for recursion.

These exercises were also designed to be executed 100% in node. That is why instead
of a prompt, readline is used with its different methods of use.

Here are the exercises:

- Fibonacci
- Merge Sort

## Installation

Clone the repository as you normally would with git and input the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Tools and Technologies

- Standard Js
- Eslint
- Node
